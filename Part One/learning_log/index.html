            In practical 1 I made a barebones site using HTML. I had to make use of HTML elements to attempt to
            accurately recreate an example web page that was provided for me.
            I found that that was a great way to refresh my knowledge of web development and HTML syntax as I had not
            done this for a long time.
            I also used this time to begin my final website, creating a portal as my intro page that contained links for
            both tasks. I also learned that additional pages can be added through hrefs to additional html files
            I created a repository for my work to have source control and arranged for my site to be hosted on Github
            Pages. I also created this learning log page and decided on a style that incorporated collapsibles.
            I decided to use Visual Studio Code for my development as it has an integrated terminal, live server
            feature, and a highlighting style that I found intuitive.
        </p>
        <a href="Part One/practical_1/practical1.html">Practical 1</a>
        <p>
            I made changes to this learning log page to fix margins, incorporate css and working js
            animation for my collapsibles. I removed inline styling for this learning log page.
            I validated the CSS for my intro page and fixed an error - changing font-size xxx-large to font-size: 36pt,
            to improve accessibility. Accessibility changes were made to the page created for practical 1.

            Practical 3 was my first exposure to JavaScript and I watched the lectures on it and CSS, and on
            accessibility. I had previously never considered that accessibility was a large
            driving force for web design methodologies so it was great to learn that and to go back and check that my
            own site was accessible.

        <p>
            This week I learend more JavaScript relating to loops, arrays, and functions. I completed practical 4 T1 in relation to arrays. This was composed of 3 parts:<br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1.html">Initial part with no function</a><br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1b.html">Part b with a function call</a><br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1c.html">Part c with an external js file</a><br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1d.html">Part d with inputs and display buttons</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I found part d especially useful as it was my first time interacting with elements on the DOM using JavaScript. I did some reading relating to the DOM and how JavaScript can enable
            certain kinds of functionality that I had previously never used. It was definitely the most eye-opening lesson so far and it helped me realise how JavaScript works and how its syntax
            follows a logical pattern. These can be found in the script file myjslib_d.js.

        <p>For week 5 I focused more on JS interactivity with the DOM. I found these tasks very useful and really helped me get my head around the role of JavaScript. 
            I have previous experience working with windows forms and tasks 2 and 3 were useful for me as it showed me how to take data from the HTML page and use it in JS programs.

        <p class="emphasis">Task One</p>
        <p>
            For week 6 I created a webpage containing a button that generates a greeting for the user on click, after they input their name in a text input element.
            If they do not put in a name, the page uses branching logic to display a generic welcome message. This page can be found <a href="Part One/practical_6/Practical6_T1a.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            For task b I modified this site so that if the user does not supply a name, the site alerts them that they must enter their name, and clears the welcome message. This can be found
            <a href="Part One/practical_6/Practical6_T1b.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="emphasis">Task 2</p>
        <p>
            I modified a prior task 4 d so that if a user does not enter their name, nothing will be generated and they will be alerted that they need to enter their name. This can be found

        </p>
        <p class="emphasis">Task 3</p>
        <p>
            For task 3 I developed a webpage where a user can input 4 marks and the system would calculate the average mark upon button click. This can be found <a href="Part One/practical_6/Practical6_T3a.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I then expanded upon this system by adding grades for marks that reached certain values. That page can be found <a href="Part One/practical_6/Practical6_T3b.html">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I expanded upon this again by including a switch statement to provide feedback on the grade. <a href="Part One/practical_6/Practical6_T3c.html">This can be found here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout all 3 of these, validation rules have been included that prevent using nonnumeric characters or numbers outside of the range 0-100.

        <p class="emphasis">Task One</p>
        <p>
            For task one I was given <a href="Part One/practical_7/Practical7_T1.html">this</a> HTML file and tasked with explaining what it outputs which I will endeavour to below:
            <p>
                This will have a browser tab title of "multiplication table" and the body of the webpage will display a table with a boarder of 3px and a cellpadding of 6px.<br/>
                In this table, there is a nested for loop. The outer loop will declare a table row and this will happen for 3 iterations. On each of these iterations, the inner 
                loop will run 5 times creating a column in the row, multiplying i (iteration number of outer loop) with j (iteration counter of inner loop). This generated cell will have its value right aligned<br/>
                Since the inner loop runs 3 times, and creates 5 cells upon each run due to the inner loop, the final table will have 15 cells in 3 rows of 5. The values will be as follows:
            </p>
            <table border="3" cellpadding="6" id="task7ExampleTable">

            <p>
                For task 2 I was tasked with creating a web page for car insurance candidate classification. visitors must input their first name, surname, age, and marital status.
                The webpage will provide information on the user's insurance class. This site can be found <a href="Part One/practical_7/Practical7_T2.html">here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                For task 3, I added validation to this webpage. Now, candidates must have reasonable names adhering to a regex, and must have an age that is numeric and greater than or equal to 17.

            For week 8 I wrote a webpage that provides an online survey for a user's favourite book genre. The initial HTML task can be found <a href="Part One/practical_8/Practical8_T1.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Following this, I added an onSubmit function to the form to validate the name upon entry. This will be executed when the submit button is clicked and will alert the user whenever their name does not meet requirements.
            <a href="Part One/practical_8/Practical8_T2.html">Link to task 2.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            My next task was to <a href="Part One/practical_8/js/Practical8_T3.js">analyse this script</a> and break down what is happening statement by statement. This I will do below:
            <ol>
                <li>Upon function invocation, the document checks whether there is a value for phone number. If there is no value, the user is alerted and the method returns false and the cursor is focused on the phone text element</li>
                <li>If there is a value, empty variables are declared to store the numbers and characters, and a variable phoneNo is declared to take the value of the form input</li>
                <li>Next, it iterates through every character in phoneNo and if the character is a value between 0 and 9, i.e. numeric, it gets added to the variable <i>numbersOnly</i></li>
                <li>Following this, <i>numbersOnly</i> should be a string composed of numeric values. Next is a check to see if it is 13 characters long. 
                    If not, an error is thrown and the user is alerted and the function returns false. The cursor is focused on the phone text element.</li>
                <li>Now we have a 13 character string composed of numbers only. We make use of substring functions to break this phone number down
                    into its components. These are the 2-digit area code, followed by the leading 0, 2-digit exchange, 4-digit extension 1 and 4-digit extension 2.</li>
                <li>A new number is then created which formats the phone in the form +## (#)## ####-####</li>
                <li>The script then sets this newNumber to be the value in the phone text element. Due to how HTML handles form submissions, 
                    this is immediately cleared upon clicking submit so I added a console log at the bottom to confirm it works.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Following this, I implmeneted the script in my previous HTML document so instead of checking for valid names, it checked the validNo method described above.
            I had to make changes to my existing solution as I was using id attributes instead of name attributes, so the <i>document.userSurvey.phone.value</i> call returned undefined.
            <a href="Part One/practical_8/Practical8_T4.html">Link to task 4.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Task 5 was to explain the workings of <a href="Part One/practical_8/js/Practical8_T5.js">this validateEmail function.</a> This is as below:
            <ol>
                <li>Upon function invocation, the document checks whether there is a value for eMail. If there is no value, the user is alerted and the method returns false and the cursor is focused on the eMail text element</li>
                <li>If there is a value for email address, variable atLoc is declared to be the index of the '@' symbol in the email string, as long as it is not the first character.</li>
                <li>Variable dotLoc is declared to be the index of the '.' character, as long as that character's position is at least 2 characters greater than that of atLoc</li>
                <li>Variable len is declared to be the length of the email address</li>
                <li>Email address is considered to be valid if atLoc and dotLoc are greater than 0, and if len is greater than dotLoc+2. i.e. the length of the email is greater than dotLoc with one appended character.
                    In other words, at least 2 characters must exist after the dot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If this is false, the user is alerted that the email is invalid and told to enter again. The document focuses on the email text element and the method returns false.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For task 6, I attached validateEmail to the onSubmit method. This can be found <a href="Part One/practical_8/Practical8_T6.html">here.</a></p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Task 7 was to explain the functionality within <a href="Part One/practical_8/js/Practical8_T7.js">this validateChoice function.</a> This is as below:
            <ol>
                <li>Upon invocation, the function declares 2 empty variables called bookChoice and x.</li>
                <li>the function iterates through all checkboxes to see if they're checked, and if they are checked, variable x contains the book choice and a newline</li>
                <li>If bookChoice is empty, i.e. no checkboxes have overwritten the initial empty string, return false and alert the user that they must select at least one book category</li>
                <li>Otherwise, get the user's name, email, and phone, and populate the textarea with these values. Return true</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            For task 8 I linked this validateChoice to my HTML page. I also included an event handler so that the submit button no longer cleared all entered text on click.
            <a href="Part One/practical_8/Practical8_T8.html">This can be accessed here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, for part 9 I combined all these validation functions and applied them all at once to my HTML. This final, fully-validated form can be found

            For week 9 I created an XHTML page containing a quiz. The quiz had 3 mutliple choice questions relating to basic webdev concepts. I used JavaScript to obtain the user's selections
            and whenever the user clicked the 'check answers' button, a text box is populated to show the user's score. I used arrays and escape characters to achieve this.
