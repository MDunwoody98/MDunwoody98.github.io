                In practical 1 I made a barebones site using HTML. I had to make use of HTML elements to attempt to accurately recreate an example web page that was provided for me.
                I found that that was a great way to refresh my knowledge of web development and HTML syntax as I had not done this for a long time.
                I also used this time to begin my final website, creating a portal as my intro page that contained links for both tasks. I also learned that additional pages can be added through hrefs to additional html files
                I created a repository for my work to have source control and arranged for my site to be hosted on Github Pages. I also created this learning log page and decided on a style that incorporated collapsibles.
                I decided to use Visual Studio Code for my development as it has an integrated terminal, live server feature, and a highlighting style that I found intuitive.

                In practical 2 I made changes to this learning log page to fix margins, incorporate css and working js animation for my collapsibles. I removed inline styling for this learning log page.
                I validated the CSS for my intro page and fixed an error - changing font-size xxx-large to font-size: 36pt, to improve accessibility. Accessibility changes were made to the page created for practical 1.

            <p>For Practical 2 I got some images and made small changes to the provided HTML so the mouseover effect changed the image src. I also created a DOM diagram of the site</p>

<!--
    Make a bunch of rows of the same width, for each practical
    Each row should contain a link to the web page of the practical exercise
    And also make them expandable to contain a learning log of the things I learned
-->
