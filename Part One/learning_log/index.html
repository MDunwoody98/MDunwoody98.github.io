            In practical 1 I made a barebones site using HTML. I had to make use of HTML elements to attempt to
            accurately recreate an example web page that was provided for me.
            I found that that was a great way to refresh my knowledge of web development and HTML syntax as I had not
            done this for a long time.
            I also used this time to begin my final website, creating a portal as my intro page that contained links for
            both tasks. I also learned that additional pages can be added through hrefs to additional html files
            I created a repository for my work to have source control and arranged for my site to be hosted on Github
            Pages. I also created this learning log page and decided on a style that incorporated collapsibles.
            I decided to use Visual Studio Code for my development as it has an integrated terminal, live server
            feature, and a highlighting style that I found intuitive.

        <p>
            I made changes to this learning log page to fix margins, incorporate css and working js
            animation for my collapsibles. I removed inline styling for this learning log page.
            I validated the CSS for my intro page and fixed an error - changing font-size xxx-large to font-size: 36pt,
            to improve accessibility. Accessibility changes were made to the page created for practical 1.

        <p>For Practical 2 I downloaded 2 images and made small changes to the provided HTML so thatthe mouseover effect
            changed
            the image source. I also created a DOM diagram of the HTML page, both of which can be found below</p>

            Practical 3 was my first exposure to JavaScript and I watched the lectures on it and CSS, and on
            accessibility. I had previously never considered that accessibility was a large
            driving force for web design methodologies so it was great to learn that and to go back and check that my
            own site was accessible.

            This week I learend more JavaScript relating to loops, arrays, and functions. I completed practical 4 T1 in relation to arrays. This was composed of 3 parts:<br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1.html">Initial part with no function</a><br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1b.html">Part b with a function call</a><br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1c.html">Part c with an external js file</a><br/>
            <a href="Part One/practical_4/Practical4_T1d.html">Part d with inputs and display buttons</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I found part d especially useful as it was my first time interacting with elements on the DOM using JavaScript. I did some reading relating to the DOM and how JavaScript can enable
            certain kinds of functionality that I had previously never used. It was definitely the most eye-opening lesson so far and it helped me realise how JavaScript works and how its syntax
            follows a logical pattern. These can be found in the script file myjslib_d.js.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 5</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>For week 5 I focused more on JS interactivity with the DOM. I found these tasks very useful and really helped me get my head around the role of JavaScript. 
            I have previous experience working with windows forms and tasks 2 and 3 were useful for me as it showed me how to take data from the HTML page and use it in JS programs.
